# bank_card_authentication
this repo contains the algortithm with which online shopping websites confirm if the card number given by the user for payment is genuine and find out the type of the card, wether it's master/visa/american express/credit/debit.

DISCLAIMER:
The data provided in this repo only contain banks in Turkey. For the country of your choosing, you should find the BIN numbers of the respective banks in that country and the code would still work just fine. 

I would appreciate it if you mentioned my name in any projects you would use this code in.
